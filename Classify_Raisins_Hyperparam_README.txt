Classify Raisins with Hyperparameter Tuning!
In this project, you’ll use the different techniques you have learned in this unit to classify different types of raisins. The dataset has been posted on Kaggle by Murat Koklu, a researcher who has studied different raisin grain types using machine learning methods.

There are two raisin grain types in this dataset, Kecimen and Besni and seven numerical predictor variables associated with each of the 900 samples in the data. You’re going to use this dataset to implement the two hyperparameter tuning methods we’ve covered in this module thusfar:

Grid Search method to tune a Decision Tree Classifier
Random Search method to tune a Logistic Regression Classifier
